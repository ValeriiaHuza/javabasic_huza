# Math Helper Application

## Overview

This Java project serves as a prototype for a Math Helper application by providing the following features:

1. Input mathematical equations containing numbers (integers or decimals), as well as mathematical operations +, -, *, /, and parentheses. The level of nesting of parentheses is arbitrary. In all equations, the unknown variable is represented by the English letter x.
2. Validate input equations.
3. Check roots for input equations.
4. Add correct equations and roots to database.
5. Search equations in database.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Maven
- PostgreSQL Database

## Configuration

To run this project, you need to change the database connection details (username, password) in the DatabaseConnection class.
